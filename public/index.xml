      <description>If you are interested in computers, technology, programming or hacking, there has been probably at least one time when you&amp;rsquo;ve wondered what would be the most secure and affordable VPN that you can get. Most times you end up using a third-party service such as (but not limited to) Mullvad or ProtonVPN, which are great solutions. Most times you get multiple VPN servers in multiple countries.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used NordVPN, ProtonVPN and some others, but unfortunately the servers are most often blocked in public Wi-Fis (for questionable purposes), which is ridiculous.</description>
